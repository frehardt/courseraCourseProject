\f0\b\fs56 \cf2 Course Project\

\cf2 Overview\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320

\b0\fs32 \cf2 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called 
\f1\fs28 \cb0 CodeBook.md
\f0\fs32 \cb1 . You should also include a 
\f1\fs28 \cb0 README.md
\f0\fs32 \cb1  in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.\
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa320

\f0\fs32 \cf2 \cb1 You should create one R script called 
\f1\fs28 \cb0 run_analysis.R
\f0\fs32 \cb1  that does the following.\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720
\ls1\ilvl0\cf2 {\listtext	1.	}Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.\
{\listtext	2.	}Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.\
{\listtext	3.	}Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\
{\listtext	4.	}Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.\
{\listtext	5.	}Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\

\cf2 Tidy Data Set\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320

\i\b0\fs32 \cf2 From Question:
\i0 \cf2  Please upload a tidy data set according to the instructions in the project description. Please upload your data set as a separate file (do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission).\

\i \cf2 From Evaluation:
\i0 \cf2  Has the student submitted a tidy data set?\

\cf2 Github Repo with Required Scripts\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320

\i\b0\fs32 \cf2 From Question:
\i0 \cf2  Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your analysis. The code should have a file 
\f1\fs28 \cb0 run_analysis.R
\f0\fs32 \cb1  in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output should be the tidy data set you submitted for part 1.\

\i \cf2 From Evaluation:
\i0 \cf2  Did the student submit a Github repo with the required scripts?\

\cf2 Code Book\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320

\i\b0\fs32 \cf2 From Overview:
\i0 \cf2  A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called 
\f1\fs28 \cb0 CodeBook.md
\f0\fs32 \cb1 .\

\i \cf2 From Evaluation:
\i0 \cf2  Please submit a code book that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.\
